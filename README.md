## Overview

Hi team,

This repository (which is just a fancy name for a place to store things) is just a copy of my local webdev folder used throughout the course. I've placed it here in this GitHub repo so that it's publicly available for you to access.

## Getting assets (like images)

To get an image for your own use (locally), you can click into any image file here in the repo, right click on it and save the image to your local machine.

Alternatively, you can visit these URLs, right click and save the images locally:

- https://g-hamilton.github.io/webdev/tim.jpg

## Viewing the source code

Simply click into an file that should contain code, such as index.html and you should see the source code, which is an exact copy of the original code that I wrote on my own machine while making the course.

## Viewing the deployed sites

I'm using GitHub PAges to deploy and host public versions of the sites that we create during the course. To access these, you can simply follow these links:
